menial things;
- mix class constructor with generateMob?

to do:
- no mana for skill use
- effects queue (stores status changes): found in mob class
- monster skills
- choose skill
- defeat xp reward, coin reduction penalties
- other locations
- finish content

bug fixing:
- edit when can enter travelling merchant's store
- defeating baron does not have coins reward
- dying does travels to village but does not end wilderness
- unsuccessful escape should be considered as combat turn
- after battle in wilderness should move auto. next (it should say the type of monster killed)
- warning menu bug (buttons not ordered porperly) : os issue?

future:
- update opening sequence text (mention the boss's minnions)
- revamp fleeing chances
- make mob class constructor 
- rebalance for fairer gameplay (enemies should get 5 attribute points per lvl)
- resize stuff game
- remove all tool tips using null
- tips screen between travelling
- hardcore or normal difficulty
- add save/ load feature
- rework ui

consider:
- shiny monsters??
- clicking the home panel should return to the game panel automatically
- change gender

lore stuff:
named characters:
• princess/ pirnce

iron sword -> steel sword -> mithril sword

• defeating the boss does not mean you can no longer attack the lair.
