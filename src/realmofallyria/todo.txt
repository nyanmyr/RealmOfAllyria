menial things;
- warning menu bug (buttons not ordered porperly) : os issue?
- mix class constructor with generateMob?

to do:
- boss battle
- monster skills
- shop
- defeat xp reward, coin reduction penalties
- other locations
- max out content
- change gender

bug fixing:
- unsuccessful escape should be considered as combat turn
- after battle in wilderness should move auto. next (it should say the type of monster killed)
- at the 20/20 turn in the wilderness you can simply click to escape a mob

future:
- update opening sequence text (mention the boss's minnions)
- revamp fleeing chances
- make mob class constructor 
- rebalance for fairer gameplay (enemies should get 5 attribute points per lvl)
- resize stuff game
- remove all tool tips using null
- tips screen between travelling
- hardcore or normal difficulty
- add save/ load feature
- rework ui

consider:
- shiny monsters??
- clicking the home panel should return to the game panel automatically
